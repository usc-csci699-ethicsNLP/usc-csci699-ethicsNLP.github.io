Although there have been impressive advancements in natural language processing (NLP), several studies reported that NLP models contain social biases. 
Even worse, the models run the risk of further amplifying the stereotypes and causing harms to people. 
As NLP technology continues to advance and be integrated into various domains such as healthcare, finance, marketing, and social media, it raises important ethical concerns that need to be addressed. 
In this course, students will critically examine the ethical implications of NLP, including issues related to bias, fairness, privacy, transparency, accountability, and social impact. 
Through discussions, case studies, and guest lectures, students will explore the ethical challenges associated with NLP and develop a deep understanding of the ethical considerations that arise when designing, implementing, and deploying NLP applications.

Students will get a broad understanding about possible issues in current NLP models and how current research has tried to alleviate those issues. 
This class will equip students with the ability to read and write critical reviews about research papers. 
At the same time, they will learn how to conduct research related to NLP fairness, interpretability and robustness.

## Grading
Grades will be based on attendance (10%), paper presentation (30%), and a course project (60%).

**Attendance and Discussion (10% total)**:
- In-Person Attendance

**Paper Reading and Discussion (30% total)**.
- Present paper, lead class discussion
- Signup as reviewers, peer review others’ presentation

**Course Project (60% total)**:
- Project Proposal (10%)
- Midterm Report (10%)
- Final Presentation (20%)
- Final Report (20%)

### Late days
You have **4 late days** you may use on any assignment
Each late day allows you to submit the assignment 24 hours later than the original deadline.
If you are working in a group for the project, submitting the project proposal or midterm report one day late means that **each member** of the group spends a late day.

## Paper Presentation
Paper presentation will help students to develop the skills to give research talk to others.
Each student will present 2 papers to the class. The student will prepare the slides for the paper and lead the discussion. 
Each week, there will be another student signed up as the feedback provider (reviewer). The presenter should finish the rehearsal of their talk with the reviewer. The reviewer will finish a feedback form at least 2 days before the class. 
Reviewer will provide the feedback to the presenter. The instructor will grade the presentation. Grading rubrics: correctness of the content (40%), clarity (20%), discussion (20%), slides & presentation skills (20%).


## Final Project
The final project can be done individually or in groups of up to 3.
This is your chance to freely explore machine learning methods and how they can be applied to a task of our choice.
You will also learn about best practices for developing machine learning methods---inspecting your data, establishing baselines, and analyzing your errors.

Each student needs to individually finish one research project related to the class topics. There should be a “deliverable” result out of the project, meaning that your project should be self-complete and reproducible (scientifically correct. 
A typical successful project could be: 1) a novel and sound solution to an interesting research problem, 2) correct and meaningful comparisons among baselines and existing approaches, 3) applying existing techniques to a new application. We will not penalize negative results, as long as your proposed approach is thoroughly explored and justified. 
Overall, the project should showcase the student’s ability to think critically, conduct rigorous research, and apply the concepts learned in the course to address a relevant problem in the field of NLP ethics.

Students should use the standard *ACL paper submission template to finish their writing report regarding the course project.
- Project proposal (10%)
Students are expected to finish a 2-page long project proposal by Week 5. The proposal should articulate the research question, justify the significance of the research, and provide evidence of the student’s knowledge and understanding of the research literature. A timeline for the project will be highly recommended to be included in the proposal.
- Midterm progress report (10%)
By Week 10, the students should finish a ~3-page progress report. The report should provide a clear statement about the research goal (could be different from the original one), a concise overview of the work completed so far, including any challenges encountered and solutions implemented and a report of some initial results.
- Final presentation (20%)
During the last two week, the students will make a 30-minute presentation about their project. It should include the research goal, the motivation, related work, their methodology and results. There will be a 5-minute QA session for other students to ask questions.
- Final project report (20%)
Students will write a final project report to describe the details about their research. The report should follow the NLP conference paper format, including the abstract, introduction, related work, result demonstration and discussion section. If the result is negative, it won’t be penalized but the students should highlight their analysis about what could be the possible reasons. The report should be in total 8 pages (excluding the reference).
